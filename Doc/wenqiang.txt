The most recent fine-grained field response (without electronics response) is here.

I corrected the units of the induced current. Instead of microampere, it should be electrons/ns. So if you take the integral of a central-path electron (along y axis), it should be close to 0.01 e/ns. As the time bins are in 0.1us, the integral is 1 electron. Since we have several electron paths in a single wire pitch, we take the average of the first 6 paths.
